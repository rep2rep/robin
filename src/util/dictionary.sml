Provide a dictionary structure for associative look-ups.
A dictionary is backed by a splay tree, which is a self-balancing binary search
tree. This means dictionaries have an order, while also having amortized O(log n)
look-up, insert, and deletion times.

(* A functor to produce dictionaries keyed with Ks.
   While we can be polymorphic in the values (i.e., so long as the type
   of the values are all the same, we don't care what they are), we
   impose a restriction upon the keys: in this case, the keys must be
   orderable through a compare function.

We build half the tree the tree from the first half of the list,

This will run in O(n) time, rather than the naÃ¯ve O(n log n) time.

Unioning arbitrary BSTs is hard because they may overlap; we cannot just
pick an element to be the root and glue them together, we would break the
tree invariant. Instead, we resort to a simple but surprisingly fast algorithm
based on functions from above. We convert the trees into lists (O(m) + O(n)),
merge the lists (which we know will be sorted, O(m + n)), then build the
final tree (from the list which must also be sorted, O(m+n)). Overall complexity
is O(m+n), which is about as good as you can hope for!

Much like unioning BSTs, intersecting them kind of sucks. And as with unioning,
we can use a surprisingly simple algorithm to get around this grossness:
listify (O(m) + O(n)), intersect (O(m + n)), treeify (O(min(m, n)))
for a total complexity of O(m+n).

While we could use union, a custom joinDisjoint function is faster (O(log n))
because we are operating on values known to be strictly less
(from the left) and strictly greater (from the right) than a particular
value. They are mutually recursive because once we find the least element,
we need to remove it from the tree. Note that this second remove MUST trigger
a base case of joinDisjoint, because we selected the element based on it
being a half-branch.
